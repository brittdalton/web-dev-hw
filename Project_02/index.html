              Night photography can be an incredible way to document your outdoor adventures, the most immense, brilliant
              images of the night sky come from 'off the beaten path' where there is very little light pollution. While
              camping, hiking, staying in a cabin for the weekend or just driving out to a deserted location for the night
              to shoot, night photography will require some practice but with a few tips you can get the impressive shot you
              are looking for. The first thing to consider is your composition, the stars are beautiful and the milky way is
              an awe inspiring but shooting straight up at the sky will give you an image without any reference for how expansive
              and impressive that night scape is. Adding a tree, a mountain range or stepping in front of the camera yourself will
              help put perspective into your image.

                Photographing the night sky isn’t quite as straightforward as one might think. In fact, it is in many cases quite opposite of ‘regular’
                landscape photography. Using the ‘wrong’ settings might lead to complete black images, and from experience, a lot of frustrations. To capture
                beautiful images of the night sky, you need to choose the right aperture, ISO and shutter speed. These are the settings you want to use:
