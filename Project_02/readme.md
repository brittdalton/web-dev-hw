<b>Q: We will soon begin CSS, learning to style our HTML documents, is there anything you are excited about in the next section? </b>

A:

This cycle I created an instructional 3 page website. The biggest issue and a huge distraction from the presentation of the site for me was using the background element and the pattern it created, I wanted to stretch my image across the screen and have it be responsive to different size browsers but I had a lot of trouble getting that to work so i used the background tag we learned in this section and it created a pattern that wasn't exactly what I wanted for a background. Specifically in the contact page where there are two moons if your browser is large enough to see the repeat, I used a vector design and exported it as a png to get the look of the geometric, dark, night-like background and this pattern repeat wasnt appealing to me.
