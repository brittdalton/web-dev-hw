<b>Q: What is alt text and why do we use it?</b>

A: Alternate text is used to provide a desctiption of an image to
a browser in order to display as an alternative in the case the
image fails to load or can not be seen (in the case of a screen reader)
and is also used by search engines to identify images. The alt tag is used to increase accessibiltiy, to ensure the message of the image is 
recieved by those who can't see it and also to assist a search engine to find your images and make sure your content is found.
