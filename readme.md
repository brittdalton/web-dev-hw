I am a taking this course to get a better understanding of websites and how to design them. I would like to create websites for projects and a portfolio. 

The history of the internet is very interesting
- ARPANET
- Paul Baran's distributed packet-switch newtowrk
- Bill Gates controlls the internet lol
- "you cant escape contact with the internet, so why not get to know it and use it"
