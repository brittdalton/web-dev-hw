Q: How many head and body elements can a page have?

A: Each page need only one head and one body, the head contains the title
and the meta data that is read by the browser, while the body contains the
content that is read or viewed by the user through an interface.

Q: What is the difference between structural and semantic markup.

A: Structural markup references the layout of the content such as the
headings, line breaks and paragraphs. Semantic markup is used to reference the
underlying meaning of the words for example, using <i>italics</i> tags will change
the slope of the lines that make up the letters but using a <em>strong</em> tag
will provide further information that this word is to be emphasised in the
sentence.
