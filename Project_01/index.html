<h1> Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night</h1>
<h3> by Dylan Thomas</h3>
<h6>Britt Dalton</h6>

<p>
Do not go gentle into that good night, <br />
Old age should burn and rave at close of day; <br />
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
</p>
<p>
Though wise men at their end know dark is right, <br />
Because their words had forked no lightning they <br />
Do not go gentle into that good night.
</p>
<p>
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright <br />
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, <br />
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
</p>
<p>
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, <br />
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, <br />
Do not go gentle into that good night.
</p>
<p>
Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight <br />
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, <br />
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
</p>
