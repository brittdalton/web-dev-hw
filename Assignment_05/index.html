            <h3>Lyrics</h3>
            <br />
            <h5>written by Justin Vernon</h5>
            <br />
          Someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me <br />
          You're laying waste to Halloween<br />
          You fucked it friend, it's on its head, it struck the street<br />
          You're in Milwaukee, off your feet<br />
          And at once I knew I was not magnificent<br />
          Strayed above the highway aisle<br />
          (Jagged vacance, thick with ice)<br />
          I could see for miles, miles, miles<br />
          3rd and Lake it burnt away, the hallway<br />
          Was where we learned to celebrate<br />
          Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me<br />
          That night you played me 'Lip Parade'<br />
          Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree<br />
          Saying nothing, that's enough for me<br />
          And at once I knew I was not magnificent<br />
          Hulled far from the highway aisle<br />
          (Jagged vacance, thick with ice)<br />
          I could see for miles, miles, miles<br />
          Christmas night, it clutched the light, the hallow bright<br />
          Above my brother, I and tangled spines<br />
          We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be<br />
          Now to know it my memory<br />
          And at once I knew I was not magnificent<br />
          High above the highway aisle<br />
          (Shake it, fake it, stick with us)<br />
          I could see for miles, miles, miles<br />
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
