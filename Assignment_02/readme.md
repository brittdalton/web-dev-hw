## Technical Report

Version Control System **VCS**
is a system that records changes to a file
over time. Version control systems allow you to
revert to previous editions, clearly see differences
and to see contributions between multiple users.
We are using Git Hub with VCS in this class to make
learning easier and more dynamic. VCS allows the
developer to go back and easliy make changes or
revert to a previous version. We are also utilizing
a program with VCS in order foster a collaborative
environment that makes working together simple and efficient.
