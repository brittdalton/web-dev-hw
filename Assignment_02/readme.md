# Assignment 2
## Technical Report

Version Control System **VCS**
is a system that records changes to a file
over time. Version control systems allow you to
revert to previous editions, clearly see differences
and to see contributions between multiple users.
We are using Git Hub with VCS in this class to make
learning easier and more dynamic. VCS allows the
developer to go back and easliy make changes or
revert to a previous version. We are also utilizing
a program with VCS in order foster a collaborative
environment that makes working together simple and efficient.

In this cycle I set up Git Hub, initiated a repository, installed
Atom text editor and learned the basics of Markup language in order
to begin work on homework. I created folders, embedded images and
tracked changes in order to get practice using the basic functions
of the programs and learn the different ways to organize and control
content. I struggled a lot in the begining and it took many attemps
to get a handle on what i was doing. I am completely new to this material
and I found the first time through I followed all the steps without really
understanding what is was I was accomplishing so I had to step back and
go through all the materials a second time and look for more resources. I
read more articles on [codeschool.com](https://www.codeschool.com/beginners-guide-to-web-development) and watched a ton of the youtube
videos from [code.com](https://www.youtube.com/user/CodeOrg). I finally started with a new repository and started
over again, this time it was much better and the simple issues I run
into I have been able to go back, make changes, push them through and
troubleshoot myself and find fixes. I did orginally post to the group
but ended  up creating a work around for myself. I am a complete beginer
and havent felt very comfortable answering questions of classmates yet
but do need to find ways to contribute even in small ways.
